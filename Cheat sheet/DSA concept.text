Q. Total number of ways of putting 2 knights into chessboard such that no one attact each other

Sol.       number of spaces  = (n^2)(n^2-1)/2;
           number of ways to attact each other = 4(n-1)(n-2);
           
           if we subtract both then we will get number of ways to put 2 knights such that no one attact each other
